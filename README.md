# The Element  



The Element is a music listening platform that allows users to play music on their mobile device. This application allows people to find new music other peers are listening to, creating their own playlists, and customize the music player using colourful themes.


The application will be able to play music and allow the user robust controls over how and what music is played. The app will feature the ability to play/pause music, skip over music, seek through the current music being played, adjust volume levels, and shuffling songs playing order. All of these user actions will be readily available and performed instantly for the user as they listen to their music.


Users will be able to create accounts so they may keep their own music collections organized and separate from other users. These accounts will allow for users to create and customize their own music playlists, view a history of their recently played music, and offer the ability to personalize the theme to change the look of the app. Users will also be able to view other user accounts and check out the music that they listen too, provided that the other user has allowed this feature.


The Element will allow the user to create their own playlists by choosing individual songs, or they can allow the app to create a playlist based on genre, mood, or the activity they are doing and more. These playlists will be highly configurable and allow the user to add, modify, sort and remove them at will.


This application is designed for people of all ages who want to listen to music. For non-technical users, the application will be intuitive and easy to use without any hassle. More experienced and advanced users will have the option to configure the music player to their liking, such as customizing the theme of the player or creating a profile for themselves to express their favourite songs and playlists for others to enjoy. 


We think that music is a universal language and that people deserve an ad-free, intuitive music listening experience. The application aims to provide anyone, regardless of technical skills, the ability to play and discover new music that suits their unique tastes. We aim to help people get exposed to new music through The Element by providing an easy way to explore other peopleâ€™s music and discover new music through suggestions made by the application.


The Element will be considered a success based on the following criteria. First, after using the Element, the average user ranks the app higher than other music playing apps they use through a survey. Secondly, the majority of user feedback through comments and ratings about our application is positive. The last criteria will be that the retention of people using the application is above 40% after a month from the release date.
