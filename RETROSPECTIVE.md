# Retrospective
---
### What went well:
We were able to achieve the core functionality of our vision. Our application is able to play music, have playlists, edit songs, and add new songs.

We were able to effictively communicate on Slack, it was one our first things we setup to allow us to ask when other group members are available to have meetings, or if they have any issues when working on features.

The actual architecture of our application was well organized, and classes were put into their logical places. We put effort into refactoring our code, to ensure we were following the three tier architecture as discussed in class.

In our first iteration, we made alot of progress with tackling difficult challanges, and by the end of the iteration we had a functioning application.

Lastly, our testing is done really well, it has good coverage for the entire application. Our system and integration tests are able to cover the core features well.

### What did not go well:
Estimation of tickets was difficult, we did not consider the minor details of implementation, and thus our issues were off the actual time that an issue requires.

Time management and accountability could improve, issues should be started earlier rather than later, and members should of kept each other in check, to ensure they are working on their issues, and not spending alot of time trying to debug code.

We should of attempted to practice test driven development more often, to get a better feel on writing tests, and be able to think about the code you are trying to implement.

Some issues pulling from master, some code that had bugs was merged in, code should of been more thoroughly checked before being merged into master.

### How we would improve:
Preferably not having other courses interfere with our project, and be able to dedicate more time to our work.

For organization, we would have more meetings to decide on who is working on what, and any issues other group members came across.

Regarding time estimates, we would record times right as we finish features and user stories, rather than waiting until the last few days, and having to remember how much time we actually spent.

### Summary:
As a group we were able to accomplish most of what we set out to do, our application works well and matches our core vision.

We were a bit too ambitious in the beginning, but we were able to reevaluate our times for iteration 2, and we were able to accomplish more than we we originally set out to do in iteration 2. In regards to our project, we believe that we did a good job on our application, we feel that it looks great and works exactly how a user would expect a music player to be.
