# The Element  

# what the music player is
The Element is a music listening platform that allows users to play music on their mobile device. This application allows user to find new music other users are listening to, creating their own playlists, and customize the music player using colourful themes.

# expand on the features here
The Element will be able play music and grant the user full control over how that music is played. The app will feature the ability to play/pause music, skip over music, seek through music being played, adjust volume levels, and allow for music to be played in a shuffled order. All of these user actions will be instant and on-demand as the users listen to their music.

The Element will allow for multiple users to have an account on the app so they may keep their own music collections separate from other users. These accounts will allow for users to create and store their own music playlists, view a history of their recently played music, and choose personalized themes to change the look of the app. Users may be able to view other user's accounts to see the music collections that they own and listen to, provided that the privacy levels for said accounts allow for it.

The player will allow the user to create their own playlists by choosing individual songs, or they can allow the app to create a playlist based on their genre, mood, activity they are doing and more. These playlists will be highly configurable and allow the user to add, modify, sort and remove them at will.

# who the music player is designed for
This application will be primarily designed for people of all ages who want to play and listen to music. For non-technical users, the application will be kept simple as-is without having to change any settings to play music. Experienced or more advanced users will have the option to configure the music player to their liking, such as adding themes or creating a profile for themselves. 

# why the music player is valuable
We think that music is a universal language, and that people deserve an ad-free, intuitive music listening experience such that any person, regardless of technical skills, is able to play and discover new music that suit their unique tastes.

# success criteria for the music player
The Element will be considered a success based on three criteria. First, after using the Element the user ranks the player higher than the 60% percentile of music playing apps they use. Secondly, if our users in-app feedback is on average positive. Finally, if the retention of users is above 40% after a month from the first download date.
