# The Element  

The purpose of the application is to serve as a music player which allows users to add music files to the app as songs and organize those songs into playlists. Additional functionality includes searching through songs in the app, viewing/editing song information, and viewing basic statistics about the state of the app.

To run the app, you may either run the app to an emulator or USB connected device through Android Studio, or compile the project into an APK and install the APK to the device and launch like any other app (there should be an icon for "The Element").
Note: When running system tests on a weaker machine, we recommend turning off device animations in the Developer Options.
