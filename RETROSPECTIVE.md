# Retrospective
---
### What went well:
We were able to achieve the core functionality of our vision. Our application is able to play music, have playlists, edit songs, and add new songs.

The actual architecture of our application was well organized, and classes were put into their logical places.

In our first iteration, we made alot of progress with tackling difficult challanges, and by the end of the iteration we had a functioning application.

Lastly, our testing is done really well, it has good coverage for the entire application. Our system and integration tests are able to cover the core features well.

### What did not go well:
Estimation of tickets was difficult, we did not consider the minor details of implementation, and thus our issues were off the actual time that an issue requires.

Time management and accountability could improve, issues should be started earlier rather than later, and members should of kept each other in check.

Some issues pulling from master, some code that had bugs was merged in, code should of been more thoroughly checked before being merged into master.
