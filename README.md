# The Element  

The Element is a music listening platform that allows users to play music on their mobile device. This application allows people to find new music other peers are listening to, creating their own playlists, and customize the music player using colourful themes.

The application will be able to play music and grant the user control over how the music is played. The app will feature the ability to play/pause music, skip over music, seek through the current music being played, adjust volume levels, and allow for music to be played in a shuffled order. All of these user actions will be instant and on-demand as the users listen to their music.

Users will be able to have an account on the app so they may keep their own music collections separate from other users. These accounts will allow for users to create and customize their own music playlists, view a history of their recently played music, and personalize the theme to change the look of the app. Users may be able to view other user accounts to see the music collections that they own and listen to, provided that the user allows it.

The Element will allow the user to create their own playlists by choosing individual songs, or they can allow the app to create a playlist based on genre, mood, or the activity they are doing and more. These playlists will be highly configurable and allow the user to add, modify, sort and remove them at will.

This application will be primarily designed for people of all ages who want to listen to music. For non-technical users, the application will be kept simple as-is without having to change any settings to play music. Experienced or more advanced users will have the option to configure the music player to their liking, such as customizing the theme of the player or creating a profile for themselves. 

We think that music is a universal language, and that people deserve an ad-free, intuitive music listening experience. The application aims to provide anyone, regardless of technical skills, the ability to play and discover new music that suit their unique tastes. We aim to help people get exposed to new music through The Element by providing an easy way to explore other peopleâ€™s music and discover new music through suggestions made by the application.

The Element will be considered a success based on the following criteria. First, after using the Element, the average user ranks the app higher than other music playing apps they use through a survey. Secondly, the majority of user feedback through comments and ratings about our application is positive. The last criteria is that the retention of people using the application is above 40% after a month from the release date.
